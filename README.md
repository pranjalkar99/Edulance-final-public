##  Overview

Edulance is an open-source project that utilizes advanced technologies such as OCR, machine learning models, and APIs to transform text documents and PDFs into interactive educational resources. The software accepts user-uploaded files, applies optical character recognition (OCR) for text documents, or extracts valuable content from PDFs. It then generates lessons, quizzes, and lesson plans based on the content using its Lesson Graph model and agents like LessonGenerator, LessonPlanner, OCRAgent, PdfAgent, QuizAgent, and TogetherLLM. Edulance provides an immersive learning experience, enabling effective teaching and interactive knowledge acquisition.

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | Edulance is a Python-based project using FastAPI as the web framework and Uvicorn for runtime serving. The application leverages containers with Docker for deployment, installing required dependencies from `requirements.txt`. It utilizes libraries like LangChain, PikePDF, PyTesseract for OCR, and TogetherAI's LLM models. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | The codebase follows a modular structure with clearly defined agents and graph files, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling. Python style guides are followed consistently, including PEP8 and PEP534. There is adequate usage of comments throughout the codebase. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | Comprehensive documentation exists for each file and agent. The `README.md` provides a high-level overview and installation instructions, while inline documentation in files clarifies complex functionality. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | Key integrations include Docker for deployment, LangChain libraries, TogetherAI's LLM models. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | The Edulance project is designed as a modular system, with distinct agents (lesson_generator, lesson_planner, quiz_agent, etc.) responsible for specific tasks in the document processing and generation pipeline. This leads to enhanced code reusability and maintainability.|
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | Main dependencies include FastAPI, Docker, Python 3.10, requirements.txt, LangChain package, PikePDF, PyTesseract, and related tools.|
